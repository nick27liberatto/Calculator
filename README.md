# SIMPLE CALCULATOR PROJECT

- This is a simple project focused on practicing the basics of backend development and a bit of frontend. 
- The code is being built mostly without external help, so the structure and functions are likely deprecated.
- This project will help me identify my strengths and weaknesses, so I can focus on improving them. 
- It is not my main project that I'm currently working on.
